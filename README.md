# videogames
This is my videogames repo, it will be initially just for Devleoping games for UIUC's CS 498 GD class, but im sure Ill find more uses for it.

## why?
I believe in generalization of content, if you are going to make a repo for games for a class, just make that a subdirectory of a larger thing. That way any things you make can be zipped up and put in a subfolder. Some games need their own repos, hence why some will just be zipped.
