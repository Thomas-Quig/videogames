# MP1 - Infinite Matrix

## Note
`bgmusic.uasset` and `bgmusic.wav` are missing from /Content/InfiniteMatrix/Audio . Replace them with the background music of your choosing. It is too big to include

## Details
This is a game where you go down a tunnel and shoot binguses, get health packs. It is based off of [this game](https://www.raywenderlich.com/454-how-to-create-a-simple-game-in-unreal-engine-4)
